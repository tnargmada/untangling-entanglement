        <p class="center">Quantum computing is an extremely confusing topic. I believe that packaging it in the form of a game
          is the best way to learn about it. Rather than trying to understand every minute detail, which is near impossible, I
          hope to give you a feel for quantum computing in an accessible and fun way. Games have the power to simplify and abstract
          an idea, while still maintaining its complexity. Anyone can learn something from a game, whether they are a child or an
          expert on the topic. This page explains how to play the game QROMA (pronounced "chroma"), and some of the quantum mechanics
          behind the game. If you're interested, you can also check out the github page to the left.</p>

        <p>This is the simplest example of a game in QROMA. The goal of the game is to highlight only the square that is
          outlined in black. To do this, you can combine squares diagonally: if the squares are the same color, they will combine upwards,
          as you see in this example. "W" combines the squares up and to the right; "S" combines the squares up and to the left.<p>
        <div class="center">
          <img class="basicgame" src="images/color1.png" alt="Simon Says Screenshot">
          <img class="arrow" src="images/arrow.jpg" alt="Arrow">
          <img class="basicgame" src="images/color2.png" alt="Simon Says Screenshot">
          <img class="arrow" src="images/arrow.jpg" alt="Arrow">
          <img class="basicgame" src="images/color3.png" alt="Simon Says Screenshot">
        </div>
        <p>As you can see, the squares aren't always the same color. If the squares are opposite colors, they combine downwards instead.
          In this case, "W" combines the squares down and to the left, and "S" combines the squares up and to the right.</p>
        <p style="float: left; width: 50%">To end the game, you press enter. The goal is to win as quickly as possible. If only one
          square is highlighted, it will remain highlighted. However, if multiple squares are highlighted, as in the screenshot to the
          right, only one square will remain highlighted. If a square is brighter (more saturated), it has a higher chance of being
          highlighted after the game ends. When the game starts, all the squares are equally highlighted, so there is a 25% chance of
          the correct square being highlighted when you press enter.</p>

          <img class="basicgame" src="images/random1.png" alt="Simon Says Screenshot">

          <img class="basicgame" src="images/random2.png" alt="Simon Says Screenshot">
        </div>
        <p>To change the color in the direction of "W" (that is, up and to the right or down and to the left), press "A." To change
          the color in the direction of "S," press "Q." By changing the colors, you can set up to combine the squares the way you want.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-bottom: 4px">Quantum-Powered</h4>
        <p style="float: left; width: 70%">This game represents a superposition of quantum bits. There's a deeper explanation of this phenomenon under the "Guide" tab,
          but I'll give you the summary. Each of the squares in QROMA represents a binary number, as you can see on the right.
          These numbers are represented by two bits. But these bits are special, because they use a quantum property called superposition,
          which allows them to be between 0 and 1, representing multiple numbers simultaneously. That's why multiple squares can be highlighted
          at the same time. The colors are called the "phase" of the superposition, and when you combine the superposition you are applying an
          operation that both creates superpositions and undoes them, depending on the amplitude (the saturation of the square) and the phase.
          That operation is called a Hadamard gate, and when you press "W" you are applying it to the 1st bit; when you press "S" you are
          applying it to the 2nd bit. When you press "A," you are changing the phase of the first bit, and when you press "Q" you are changing
          the phase of the second bit.</p><img src="images/diagram.png" alt="Diagram" style="width: 250px; height: 250px; margin-left: 40px">
