    <h1 class="center">About This Project</h2>
    <p class="center" style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right:100px">I'm Adam Grant, and this website was created to
     introduce quantum computing to a wider audience by packaging it in an accessible way, through Quantum Simon Says. I was
     inspired by early classical computer games, especially Spacewar!, which was created in 1962 for the PDP-1, one of the
     earliest commercial computers. That game allowed researchers to see beyond the applications that they were working on,
     made them more creative in their programming, and changed their view of the future. If you are interested in quantum
     computing, I highly recommend checking out <a href="https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/qx/editor">IBM's public
     quantum computers</a>, or another one of the resources listed below. If you want to check out the code behind Quantum
     Simon Says, or try to add improvements to it, check out the <a>Github page</a>. The game was written with ProjectQ and
     pygame.<br><br>
     If you have any questions, feel free to email me at adam123grant@gmail.com.</p><br>
